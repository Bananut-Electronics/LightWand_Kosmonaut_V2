# What is the LightWand Kosmonaut V2?
The _**LightWand Kosmonaut V2(LWK2)**_ is an Arduino based device which can control LED Stripes in order to display images stored in an SD card. Additionally, it has a number of additional features to use it as a sensor data display device or a simple pattern generator for lightpainting photography.

# So, if this one is V2... where is V1?
The _**LightWand Kosmonaut V1(LWK1)**_ was developped by Pablo dMM in 2015 (The same guy that developped this one) and the repository can be found here:

This project was originally based on the first _LightWand_ made by _**Michael Ross**_ in 2014 (http://mrossphoto.com/wordpress32/), please check out his awesome work. The LWK1 inherited form this version the main concept and two SW functions (described in code).

It is a similar tool to the commercial product _**Pixelstick**_ (http://www.thepixelstick.com/).

# Show me what can be done with it.
These are some photos made with this tools, and that should guide you an idea of what is it and how could it be used. None of these photos are processed (further that contrast and brightness and perhaps saturation):
